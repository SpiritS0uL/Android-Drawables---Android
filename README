-- Description

This application will list all public and private Android resources (i.e. resources located under 'android.R.*' and under 'com.android.internal.R.*') for the current device.

If the resource is a drawable or a colour the background colour of the list can be changed to see how it looks next to a different colour.

	* This application used to be called Android Drawables.
	* This is not a drawing app.
	* Probably only useful to developers :)
	* No ads.

WARNING: Internal resources (anything under 'com.android.internal.R') are not guaranteed to be in all devices/android versions.
Do not reference them directly in your application or it will crash on untested device configurations.
